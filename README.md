# My-Home
Home Device Managment assessment

My task was to quickly build a small Android app to list Home Devices and show their details. 

The app has:
  - offline cache for network responses.
  - MVP Architecture.
  - Dependency Injection.

Library used:
  - Dagger 2 - A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.
  - Volley - A networking library for Android.
